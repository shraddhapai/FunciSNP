# FunciSNP
Shraddha's modifications to Simon Coetzee's BioConductor package [FunciSNP](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FunciSNP.html).

**Disclaimer:** This version is useful to SP for local computation. It is out of sync with the latest BioC version of FunciSNP because, among other things, the version of R is different. 

Started with: version 1.8.0 from BioC.

**Key differences:**
* Allows use of locally downloaded 1KGP VCF files instead of pinging an online server
